      <p class="address cursive">Dear Willard Second Floor Ladies&rsquo; Room,</p>
      <p class="letter-body">I was recently asked what love means to me. One of the first words that came to mind was sacrifice, and truth be told, I have sacrificed a lot for you: wearing shoes at all times in case there is a giant puddle on your floor, keeping said shoes on in the shower, and breathing through my mouth as soon as I open your door because you smell like feces covered in wing sauce. Regardless, I have learned that there is no better place to learn about the really weird habits of humankind than within your walls. This includes myself &ndash; apparently I&rsquo;m the only one that does ballet barre workouts while brushing my teeth. Thanks for never judging me. Our relationship, unfortunately, was ill fated from the start, and I will be leaving you soon. Please say you&rsquo;ll never forget me, as I know I&rsquo;ll never forget you &ndash; my first college bathroom.</p>
